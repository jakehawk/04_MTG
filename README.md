## Revisiting Project 2  
It's been a long time since our second project and I feel like now I can actually get closer to building what I wanted to build.  I will be focusing on a site that will help players of all skill levels of magic make better decks.  It's a subject I am very familiar with and something I really want to use. I couldn't really think of anything else I could work on that I would put the same amount of effort into.
